## Requirements
Python 3.4, TensorFlow 1.3, Keras 2.0.8 and other common packages listed in `requirements.txt`.


## Installation
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Clone this repository
3. Run setup from the repository root directory
    ```bash
    python3 setup.py install
    ``` 
3. Download pre-trained COCO weights (mask_rcnn_coco.h5) from the [releases page](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases).
4. (Optional) To train or test on MS COCO install `pycocotools` from one of these repos. They are forks of the original pycocotools with fixes for Python3 and Windows (the official repo doesn't seem to be active anymore).

    * Linux: https://github.com/waleedka/coco
    * Windows: https://github.com/philferriere/cocoapi.
    You must have the Visual C++ 2015 build tools on your path (see the repo for additional details)
